# List of Cryptocurrency Faucets

A faucet is a place where you can get minimal accounts in different cryptocurrencies to get you started and to test out the services of a given coin. Usually, faucets have a minimum payout. Here is a list of tested and validated faucets for cryptocurrency - such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, as well as a few more unknown coins.

The oldest and most reputable faucets are [moonbitcoin](http://moonbit.co.in/?ref=0ddabd92bff0) \(BTC\), [moonlitecoin](http://moonliteco.in/?ref=5b1f195e5346) \(LTC\) and [moondogecoin](http://moondoge.co.in/?ref=73ab2d9b1bb1) \(DOGE\). I am adding other ones i find on a regular basis. If you want to add your faucet to the list, contact me via [github](https://github.com/kreiser55).
