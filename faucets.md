# List of Cryptocurrency Faucets

A faucet is a place where you can get minimal accounts in different cryptocurrencies to get you started and to test out the services of a given coin. Usually, faucets have a minimum payout. Here is a list of tested and validated faucets for cryptocurrency - such as Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin, as well as a few more unknown coins.

The oldest and most reputable faucets are moonbitcoin \(BTC\), moonlitecoin \(LTC\) and moondogecoin \(DOGE\). I am adding other ones i find on a regular basis. If you want to add your faucet to the list, contact me via github.
